    Given a time-series with the Total Return of a stock,

    time-series, which tells us how many time-steps before
    the time-series increased above that level. This is
    used to measure how many days it took for a stock to
    recover from a temporary loss.

    Note that an integer value of zero means that the
    time-series never reached the given value again.

    a stack to keep track of the previously seen elements.
